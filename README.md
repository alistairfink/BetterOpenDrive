# BetterOpenDrive
BetterOpenDrive is a client application utilising OpenDrive's public APIs. This application was born out of pure frustration gained from directly using OpenDrive's official app. I found that many of the features that it had were not done well and many of the futures that I wanted did not exist in the app. After discovering the existence of public APIs and available documention this led me to make my own.

WARNING: This application is not yet completed and as such the UI/UX aspects have not been worked on (current UI is place holder until functionality is ready).
